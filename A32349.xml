         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <label>II.</label> We will and command, that all Our Officers and Subjects by Sea and Land, do, as much as in them lies, prohibit the roving and hovering of Men of War ſo near the Entry of any of Our Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours or Our Coaſts, as that Merchantmen homeward or outward bound to or from any of Our Ports ſhall apprehend their paſſage to be unſafe, or their danger of being ſet upon and ſurprized ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, to the hindring and diverting of Trade and Commerce from Our Ports; And We do ſtrictly charge and require Our ſaid Officers and Subjects, to reſcue, ſuccour and defend all Merchantmen and others, that ſhall happen to be ſet upon or ſurprized ſo near Our Coaſts, or the Entry of Our Harbours, as may be eaſily conſtrued to be under Our more ſpecial Care and Protection; and that they apprehend and ſeize all Offenders in this kind, in order to bring them to condigne puniſhment, for diſturbing and hindring the Trade and Commerce betweén Our Subjects and thoſe of Our Neighbours and Allies.</p>
            <p>
               <label>III.</label> That where it happens that a Man of War of the one party come into any of Our Ports, where there ſhall be a Merchantman (one or more) of the other party, ſuch Merchant Ship or Ships, if they deſire it, ſhall be ſuffered to depart the Port two Tides before the Man of War, to the intent they may get themſelves out of his reach and purſuit; And if it happen that any Man of War (one or more) of the one party do come in while any Man or Men of War of the other party are in Our Ports or Roads, none ſhall be ſuffered to go out to Sea the ſame Tide with his Enemy; but thoſe that are moſt likely to purſue and engage aſſoon as they are out of Our Ports, ſhall be ſtayed and detained two Tides after thoſe of the adverſe party are put to Sea.</p>

               <label>IV.</label> And We do hereby charge and require all Vice-Admirals, Cuſtomers and other Our Officers in Ports and Maritime Places, that they viſit all Ships and Veſſels belonging to Our Subjects, that ſhall victual, furniſh, or recruit themſelves for Voyages at Sea; And that they ſtay and detain all ſuch as they ſhall ſuſpect by the proviſion or furniture to be deſigned for any other then trading or fiſhing Voyages, until further Order from Vs, or Our High Admiral, or Commiſſioners for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Office of High Admiral.</p>
            <p>
               <label>V.</label> And We do further ſtraitly Command and Require all Governors and Officers in Ports, and other Maritime places, not to ſuffer any Private Man of War, Sayling by a Foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and having any Prize or Prizes (that he may have taken) in his power and poſſeſſion, to ſtay above Twenty four hours in any of Our Ports or Harbors, unleſs he be thereto conſtrained by contrary Winds, Blocking up by Enemies, or other Diſtreſs; yet ſo, that during his ſtay he do not break Bulk, Sell, Barter, or leave behind him any of his Prize-goods, upon any terms or pretence whatſoever.
